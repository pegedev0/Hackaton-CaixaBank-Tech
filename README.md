## 💫 Guides

**⚠️As this is a hackathon, with more time than usual and we are competing, we have created a long challenge. It is crucial to get the app working in order to correct it, so it is important to manage time well and prioritise rather than trying to get everything done and the app not working when it is corrected.⚠️**

### General information

**As this challenge is part of a hackathon, participants are free to modify anything they need to implement their solution. There are no limits of any kind, neither technological nor visual.**

**A [deployed website](https://react-personal-finance-assistant.vercel.app) with all the functionalities to be created is provided so that participants have a clear reference of the expected performance.**

**It is possible to add as many functionalities as desired.**

**The code provides a basis on which to work, and also contains comments that may be useful.**


### Correction

The correction will be done manually.

Therefore, standards will have to be applied:

- The execution will have to be: `npm i`, `npm start`. Any project that does not work properly when running these commands will not score.
- To evaluate the purpose of the tests `npm test` will be run. If it does not work, this task will be scored as 0.
- A small part of the score will be all visual. In this case the overall look and feel of the application will be evaluated, giving an extra score of 100 points.
- By default the version of Node that will be used is **Node 20(LTS)**.

## 📤 Submission

1. Solve the proposed tasks.
2. Continuously push the changes you have made.
3. The last commit will be the one to be taken into account for manual correction.

## 📊 Evaluation

The final score will be given according to whether or not the objectives have been met.

In this case, the challenge will be evaluated on 2250 (1750 for tasks, 400 for code quality and 100 for the visual part) points which are distributed as follows:

- **Task 1**: 200 points
- **Task 2**: 150 points
- **Task 3**: 100 points
- **Task 4**: 100 points
- **Task 5**: 100 points
- **Task 6**: 150 points
- **Task 7**: 150 points
- **Task 8**: 100 points
- **Task 9**: 150 points
- **Task 10**: 100 points
- **Task 11**: 100 points
